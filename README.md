**System Modeling and Profiling**  
The goal of this project is twofold: (i) to determine the characteristics of a computerâ€™s caches, and
(ii) to leverage the obtained knowledge about the caches in order to optimize the performance of a given
program.

**Instruction Level Parallelism**  
The main purpose of this project is to provide a direct and close contact to the
operation of a pipelined computer architecture, as well as to the techniques that are commonly applied
in order to maximize the efficiency of the developed computer programs.
